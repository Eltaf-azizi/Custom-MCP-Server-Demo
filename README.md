<h1 align="center">ðŸ§  Custom MCP Server Demo</h1>

This project is a Custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server built using Python, Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate how to create a custom server that communicates using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) â€” a simple, custom-designed protocol useful for building flexible communication systems between clients and servers.


## ðŸ“Œ What is this project about?
This project helps you understand how to:

Build a custom server using Python's socket library

Implement a custom protocol (MCP) to handle communication between clients and the server

Manage client connections and message handling in a structured way

Send and receive custom commands and data with context-aware processing

It serves as a learning base for creating more complex client-server systems, such as multiplayer games, chat applications, or custom networked tools.
