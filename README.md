<h1 align="center">🧠 Custom MCP Server Demo</h1>

This project is a Custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server built using Python, It’s designed to demonstrate how to create a custom server that communicates using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) — a simple, custom-designed protocol useful for building flexible communication systems between clients and servers.


## 📌 What is this project about?
This project helps you understand how to:

 - Build a custom server using Python's socket library

 - Implement a custom protocol (MCP) to handle communication between clients and the server

 - Manage client connections and message handling in a structured way

 - Send and receive custom commands and data with context-aware processing

It is a learning base for creating more complex client-server systems, such as multiplayer games, chat applications, or custom networked tools.

## 🚀 Features

 - 🌐 TCP-based custom server built in Python

 - 🔄 Model Context Protocol: structured message handling

 - 📡 Real-time communication between client and server

 - 🧩 Easy to extend with new message types or functionalities

 - 🧪 Great for learning networking, protocol design, and server architecture


## 🔧 Requirements

 - Python 3.8+

 - Basic understanding of networking (sockets, TCP)

 - No external dependencies required


## 🛠 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

       git clone 
       cd custom-mcp-server
   
3. Run the server:

       python server.py
